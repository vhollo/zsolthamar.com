<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
	
<p>
	It is not meant to tell about my life but to share the fascination what music has always brought to me.</p>
<p>
	My parents often mentioned that I was not yet able to utter sounds to form comprehensible words when I cradled myself by singing already quite clearly Bach D-minor piano concerto.
</p>
<p>
	I still feel that while words may betray, sounds of music always provide me with comfort and happiness.
</p>
<p>
	Since I am not only composing music but also interpreting it as a conductor, my pleasure is in full fruition â€“ as a kind
	of medium I can acquaint my audience with the music what "hallows and heals".
